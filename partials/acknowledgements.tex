\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank all those who have helped me directly or indirectly in the completion of this thesis.
Specifically, I want to thank Antoine~Gaulin and Johanna~Schwartzentruber for their feedback on early versions of chapter~\ref{chapter:introduction} and section~\ref{section:parser-introduction} during writing group meetings.
I also want to thank my sister Marie-Laurence~Ouimet for bearing with my convoluted ramblings and code explanations on the whiteboard, as well as for reading parts of the thesis.
Last but not least, I want to thank my advisor, Brigitte~Pientka, for her sustained support and trust throughout the development of the changes I proposed to the \Beluga system.

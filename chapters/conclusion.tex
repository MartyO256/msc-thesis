% TODO:

%The \Harpoon interactive proof environment is too tightly coupled with the rest of the \Beluga system.
%In particular, \Harpoon proof scripts are too verbose, error-prone and redundant.
%Indeed, serializing the meta and computation contexts is unnecessary since they can always be reconstructed, albeit with different names for the bindings.
%Holes in \Beluga programs can represent backward reasoning settings.
%The following snippet describes a proof by backward reasoning, whereby a proof for the subgoal can be constructed by invoking f with unknown arguments x and y.
%
%let x : t1 = ?
%and y : t2 = ?
%in f x y

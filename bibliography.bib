  abstract="We present one way of combining a logical framework and first-order logic. The logical framework is used as an interface to a first-order theorem prover. Its main purpose is to keep track of the structure of the proof and to deal with the high level steps, for instance, induction. The steps that involve purely propositional or simple first-order reasoning are left to a first-order resolution prover (the system Gandalf in our prototype). The correctness of this interaction is based on a general meta-theoretic result. One feature is the simplicity of our translation between the logical framework and first-order logic, which uses implicit typing. Implementation and case studies are described.",

Lean 4 is fully extensible: users can modify and extend the parser, elaborator, tactics, decision procedures, pretty printer, and code generator. The new system has a hygienic macro system custom-built for ITPs. It contains a new typeclass resolution procedure based on tabled resolution, addressing significant performance problems reported by the growing user base. Lean 4 is also an efficient functional programming language based on a novel programming paradigm called functional but in-place. Efficient code generation is crucial for Lean users because many write custom proof automation procedures in Lean itself.",
